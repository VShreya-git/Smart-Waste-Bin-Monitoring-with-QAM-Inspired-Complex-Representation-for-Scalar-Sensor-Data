# Smart-Waste-Bin-Monitoring-with-QAM-Inspired-Complex-Representation-for-Scalar-Sensor-Data
A complete Smart Waste Bin prototype was developed using ESP32, ultrasonic and IR sensors, and in-built WiFi module for message transmission. MATLAB-based post-processing of sensor readings using the QAM-inspired mapping revealed enhanced insight into waste bin dynamics and system behavior.
